# Success Criteria for Chat Protocol Project

**The Chat project will be considered a success if:**

**A fully functional test system is delivered on or before December 20th.**

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

- No one circles &quot;No&quot; on the first two questions

- If anyone circles &quot;Yes, with reservations&quot; on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to December 21st to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before December 19th will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**CPP supervisors can print all reports outlined in spreadsheet sample reports provided during 13/12 requirements meeting.**

These reports shall be in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the data properly displayed. The data on the report should accurately reflect that which is in the database.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**The System is properly documented.**

First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.
