**Introduction**

This document outlines the outcome of completed system tests. Incidents, Defects and Changes that need to be made will be presented here formally. Although the ideas expressed here are separate entities, they will be combined into this one document.

**Incidents**

This section defines the incidents discovered while performing various tests on the system. This section will expand as more incidents are found. For each incident, the initial Incident ID (excluding Letter) determines the test case that it ties to. For example, Incident ID 5.4.6.4-B is an incident stemming from test case 5.4.6.4.

**Defects**

At this time, defects that were found were labeled as incidents. Many of what we consider defects were self made defects that were hard to find but easy to correct. Incidents were found that had the opportunity of turning into defects in the system had they not been able to be corrected.

**Summary**

The testing procedure to date has been conducted using manual system testing and concurrent unit testing. Features tested include but are not limited to:

- Ability for an individual to select a category and read questions/answers pertinent to that category

Test Case: 4.1.4.1, 4.1.4.2

- Ability for a user to login via username and password and submit a survey

Test Case: 4.1.4.2

- Ability to add/remove users of the system (back-end) as needed

Test case: 4.1.4.2, 4.1.4.2

Further system testing will be done as newly implemented features become available. These features include all the functionality of the Administration Page which entails adding and removing users. To date, one incident has been found and is currently undergoing corrective measures. This incident was determined by a defect from the code more properly on the communication between the chat and the server.
